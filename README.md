Submit all your codes and reports (.pdf) to this repository.

Since GitHub has a strict file limit of 100MB, 
if you have any file that is bigger than this size, add its filename extension to the .gitignore file.

Then add a block of code in your .ipynb or .py file, 
which enables your code to automatically download those files.
